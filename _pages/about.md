I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo.  
My research interests lie in medical image analysis, vision-language models, and computer vision, with a particular focus on developing efficient and interpretable deep learning frameworks for large-scale pathology image processing.

My current research centers on building deep learning models that can effectively integrate morphological and molecular information from whole-slide images (WSIs).  
By exploring multi-scale representation learning and spatially aware modeling, I aim to improve the accuracy and interpretability of computational pathology systems in clinical applications.  

Before joining Vanderbilt, I received my B.S. degree from the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University** in 2024, where I developed a strong interdisciplinary background in bioscience and automation.  
This cross-domain experience continues to shape my research approach, bridging biology, machine learning, and computer vision to advance data-driven biomedical discovery.

Outside of research, I enjoy baseball, cooking and fitness.
