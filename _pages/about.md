I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo.
My research interests lie in medical image analysis, vision-language models, and computer vision, with a particular focus on developing efficient and interpretable deep learning frameworks for large-scale pathology image processing.
Before joining Vanderbilt, I received my B.S. degree from the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024.
Outside of research, I enjoy baseball, cooking and fitness.
